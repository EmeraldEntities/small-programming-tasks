# small-programming-tasks

A collection of small things that I've made that aren't big enough to be called a "project" of its own.
Each folder has its own individual READMEs that have more detail, but I'll list them here.

## contents
- computer-sorter -- A small program made to assign computers
- web-scraper -- A small test on python requests and BeautifulSoup

## things i have yet to do
- nothing comes to mind yet
