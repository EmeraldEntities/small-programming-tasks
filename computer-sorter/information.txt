Basically, this program was made as a small challenge to sort people based on computer groupings. This means trying to match people with 
preferable seatings based on how many computers they request. The idea behind this was that people probably want to sit next to their
friends if they're reserving a computer.

(EG. If a person asks for 3 computers (for something like a school project), it'll look for a group of computers with exactly 3 free ones, then
a group of computers with more than 3 but at least 3 free ones, then finally 3 free computers from all of the groupings.)
